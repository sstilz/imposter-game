## Return of the Imposter
This game is the final project for the Caltech course, "CS 3: Introduction to Software Design". It was inspired by the game Among Us and was coded in collaboration with three other group members.

## Game Instructions
- **Summary**: You, the player, are the imposter. Your goal is to enter the ship and travel through vents, avoiding other crewmates at all costs. When you pass all the levels, you have sabotaged the ship and achieved victory!
- **Levels**: There are 7 total levels. Press “R” to restart a level and “P” to pause the game. The level is completed when the player enters the vent. There is one vent per level. You can restart a level any number of times with no penalty.
- **Health**: At the start of each level, the player has maximum health, as denoted by the heart icons on the top left of the screen. The player loses health from crewmate bullets and damaging obstacles (displayed in red). There is no way to regain health. When the player runs out of health, the level restarts, and the health is reset.
- **Crewmates**: The crewmate fires bullets at the player whenever the player is within line of sight. Try to dodge those bullets to stay alive longer.
- **Tongue Mechanic**: The player has a tongue that acts as a grapple gun. The tongue can be ejected whenever the tongue charging bar (on the top left of the screen) is green. To shoot the tongue, press anywhere on the screen with your mouse. Use the tongue to damage crewmates and access hard-to-reach places.
- **Keys/Doors**: Collect keys to open doors of the same corresponding color. Collected keys are displayed in your inventory on the top left of the screen.
Trampolines: These will launch you upwards so that you can collect keys crucial to unlocking doors.
- **Game Controls**: Use the A, D, and W keys to move left, right, and jump, respectively. Use your mouse to shoot the tongue.
- **Mission Assigned**: Sneak inside the ship so you can sabotage those pesky crewmates and show them who’s the real sus-master. But don’t get too sus; you might go insane! You will when you complete the final level. Good luck!
